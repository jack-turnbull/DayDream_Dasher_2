           <p class="card-text">Welcome to the Daydream Dasher blog page, this page will be used to update you on the development progress of the game! We will talk about the challeneges we face and what we are doing in different blogs. The application we have used to develop our game is unity, this is because it has the ability to make our game compatible with many platforms, if necessary, with easy implementation; there is a very supportive community, making it easier and quicker to deal with issues throughout development.</p>

           <p class="card-text">The DayDream Dasher website has been built over numerous iterations. The website would be reviewed by the DayDream Dasher team at the end of each iteration, so we could give feedback on what we think should change. As a result, we have ended up with a website which will capture the attention of our target audience. The website contains lots of different blue and white colours as it is symbolic of the sky, typically referenced when describing a 'daydreamer' as they are always 'up in the clouds'.  The navigation around the website is also very simplistic, making it easier for any user to get around the site!</p>

           <p class="card-text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
