                 <p class="card-text"> The application we have used to develop our game is unity, supplemented by C# scripts to provide functionality.

The benefits of using unity for our project are the ability to make our game compatible with many platforms, if necessary, with easy implementation; there is a very supportive community, making it easier to deal with issues throughout development much quicker than with other platforms; unity is compatible with C#, which is very similar in syntax and structure to Java, which our team have prior experience with; lastly, Unity was highly suitable for a collaborative development project. There is in-built support for GitHub, allowing our developers to work collaboratively with little hinderance.</p>
